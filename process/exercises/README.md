# Evaluation
## Standard 
The code of the exercises is going to be evalauted considering this standard:

1. Readability and Maintainability (1-5):
- Check if the code is well-commented and has clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Assess the overall structure and organization of the code. Is it easy to follow?
- Look for code duplication and assess whether the code follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

2. Correctness (1-5):
- Review the code for logical errors and ensure it produces the expected output.
- Check if the code handles edge cases and error conditions appropriately.
- Verify that the code adheres to the specified requirements or design specifications.

## Scale 
Certainly! Here's the information converted to Markdown format:

**5: Excellent**

- Code is well-organized, highly readable, and maintainable.
- Adheres to coding standards and follows best practices.

**4: Good**

- Code is generally well-organized and readable.
- Adheres to coding standards but may have a few minor deviations.

**3: Average**

- Code is somewhat organized and readable, but improvements could be made.
- Adheres to some coding standards but may have notable deviations.

**2: Below Average**

- Code organization and readability need significant improvements.
- Deviations from coding standards are significant.

**1: Poor**

- Code organization and readability are severely lacking.
- Major deviations from coding standards.

## Mark 

$$ Mark = Readbility\_Maintainability * 0.2 +  Correctness * 0.8 $$
$$  1 <= Mark <= 5 $$
